### You found me! 👋  
![github banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be86d225-3a1a-481e-9842-fd35f2908203)

Hi, I’m Princilla, a self-taught data analyst who turns raw, messy datasets into clean, story-packed insights that **actually** drive action. I don’t just “love data”—I use it to solve problems, automate the boring stuff, and make teams smarter.

Tools I mess with regularly:
Mainly Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel, and in some cases, not regular ones  but whatever else gets the job done.

Outside of data, I’m big on travel, always hunting stories, whether they come from people, places, or a weird-ass dataset.
