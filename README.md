Hi there! Iâ€™m Princilla, a self-taught data professional who broke into data from a non-technical background. My goal is to demystify data and make it less intimidating for others. I believe once the confusion is removed, data becomes gold for decision-making and insights!

Besides my love for data, Iâ€™m a travel enthusiastâ€”discovering stories through places, people, and datasets alike.
