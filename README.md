### You found me! 👋  
![github banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be86d225-3a1a-481e-9842-fd35f2908203)

Hey! I’m **Princilla** — a self-taught data analyst who loves wrangling messy data, building dashboards, and turning insights into action.

I believe in clarity over jargon, real results over fluff, and sharing what I learn with the world.

💻 **Tools I speak fluently:**  
Python | SQL | Power BI | Excel | Tableau | Looker Studio | Pandas | NumPy

🌍 Outside of data? I’m chasing stories through travel and people.
